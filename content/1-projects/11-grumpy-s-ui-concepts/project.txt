Text: Commissioned by <a href="https://ahoylemon.xyz/">Lemon</a> for Grumpy's Bar and Grill in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The direction was a mixture of a grungy bowling ball alley, Minneapolis's vintage neon signage, and 50s design aesthetic, while still appealing as a modern bar. The redesign would utilize the existing logo and blue/red colors. Concepts covered the landing page, standard design for one location, contact page, and menu; all pages had a concept for full-width and mobile versions.
