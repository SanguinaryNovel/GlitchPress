The Superintendent of Thornapple-Kellogg School District requested a set of conceptual site plans to use as talking points for a campaign to create an athletics complex on a existing plot of land. A civil engineer created the original document, passing along a flattened PDF to my desk.

The document was then redrawn in Illustrator, applying textures over the flats to create a traditional watercolor concept image. The document was then modified to create an alternative plan for a potential new elementary building. The final product was printed on Gator board and scored down the back, allowing the large boards to be folded up and packed away in a 30"x40" portfolio for easy travel.
