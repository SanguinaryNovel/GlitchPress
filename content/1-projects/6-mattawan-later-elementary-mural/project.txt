Kingscott was nearing completion of a state-of-the-art elementary for Mattawan Consolidated Schools. To celebrate this, the company and school administration wanted to place a 31'4"x7' mural in the main hallway. The mural was to be made of 8 3'11"x7' printed Moxie panels.

The concept for the mural went through many, many iterations; the first plan was to select a stock image that most adhered to the general color scheme, but this was rejected due to limitations in size and image selection. Several pencil concepts were provided, and the school settled on a sweeping illustration that would show what subjects a Later Elementary student would learn about. 

The original drawing included not only school subjects, but imagery important to the Mattawan community and Michigan. The pencils were scaled down to 1/3 the original size, then hand inked. The inked images were then scanned in, painted and textured in Photoshop.
