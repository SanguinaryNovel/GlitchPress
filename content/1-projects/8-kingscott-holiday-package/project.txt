During the holiday season Kingscott, like almost all companies, would provide gifts and treats to current and potential clients. In 2017, the Marketing Director proposed giving the money to the Empowerment Plan, a Detroit-based group that hires women who live in shelters to sew together coats for the homeless. You can read more about the coats here - http://www.empowermentplan.org/the-coat. 

The leadership team wanted to still give a small gift to clients, with a card and a publication similar to the Working Together magazine. The publication was scaled back to 16 page 5.5"x7" booklet,  telling the story of the Empowerment coat, celebrating clients in each market, and changes at Kingscott. 

The card was shaped and designed to resemble the actual Empowerment coat, folding up into a band in the same fashion. Inside a mailing label-sized sticker indicated where the clients coat had gone, one of four shelters selected in Michigan. The coat card wrapped around the publication and an optional card for personal notes. The coat cards were hand cut and folded, as outsourced printing of die-cut cards were massively out of budget.

I'm terrified of bone folders now, but 100% totally worth it.
