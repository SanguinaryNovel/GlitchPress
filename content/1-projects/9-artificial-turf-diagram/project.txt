The project director for Big Rapids Public Schools had been running into a problem during the Facility Committee meetings. The school wanted to build a new football field, but the community insisted that the clay fields would not drain and the artificial turf field would just be consistently flooded and a waste of money. 

The project director asked me to create a document that explained how an artificial turf field drains, sent me a CADD cross section of a turf, and that was about it. After asking a civil engineer to teach me how a football field drains and how it works, I transformed the existing cross-section into something easier to understand. I referenced samples of drainage tubing and turf to create the structure cross-section, finishing the final product in Illustrator.  The final document was assembled in InDesign with some basic copy.
