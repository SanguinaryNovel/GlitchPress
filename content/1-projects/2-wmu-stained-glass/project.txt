Kingscott was working for Western Michigan University under a Time and Materials contract with the renovation of Kanley Chapel being a part of that work. The exterior louvers in the tower were to be removed and the WMU group in charge of campus beautification requested artwork for the panels.  Traditional stained glass was prohibitively expensive, so the school and Kingscott settled on a digitally printed film.

The school was unsatisfied with the designs provided by the design architects, so project landed on my desk. Speaking with the WMU group, they indicated that the artwork must be secular, but also celebrate campus life.  The group also stressed abstraction in form, and to relate it to the student-made traditional stained glass work in the chapel building proper.

The concept for the panels started by thinking about the function of a chapel on a university campus. Religious services provide a "guiding light" to students, helping them find their way in a new world. Keeping it more secular, I focused on four aspects of humanity and education that provide a guiding light for all of man: literature, sciences, arts, and the human connection. 

The images were drafted out and outlined in Illustrator, the color palette pulled directly from the Kanley Chapel stained glass work. Since a film cannot directly mimic the nature of stained glass,  the effect was replicated through pulling the brightest highlights of the Kanley glass and overlaying stained glass textures in Photoshop. The films were then applied to each side of the glass panes, deepening the color.
