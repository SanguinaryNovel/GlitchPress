Text: Commissioned by <a href="https://ahoylemon.xyz/">Lemon</a> for his talk at Kansas City Developer Conference, "Let's Launch A Website Right Friggin' Now!". The website in question, Pretend.World, posits you as an uninvited guest crashing an impersonator party. The goal is to make your way through the party by trying to guess who the impersonators are.  The illustrations reveal your ultimate goal, as well as a win and loss screen. The illustration style followed from the Limelight font, creating  a sort of 20s, Erte feel in linework and color.
