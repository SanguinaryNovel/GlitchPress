Kingscott work is often pre-determined in scope and design, either by adhering to preset templates or strict time limits. Hospitality invitations are one of the few times I can really experiment and get a little fancy. Since this hospitality was extremely limited in space, this was another opportunity to create something more complex.

The outside envelope was fashioned to look like a baseball glove, blue linework printed on kraft cardstock; these envelopes were hand cut and glued. The insert continued the baseball theme, with the cut grass patterns. The whole packaged was designed to fit into a standard A7 envelope.
