Kingscott was working in tandem with Leading Age of Michigan to co-host a reception in Kalamazoo for the annual Leading Age convention. This event included a catered hospitality at SkyDeck, a tour of the Kingscott office, and a gift bag filled with Kalamazoo-based gifts.  In addition, I proposed a "Local's Guide", a map and resource of popular shops and restaurants in the downtown Kalamazoo area. 

Branding and colors were extrapolated from the convention's theme and colors, combining posterized images and vector illustrations of the downtown area. From that, large trifold guide, invitation, and gift guide were created for the event.
